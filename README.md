ðŸ•’ Duration of Survival Calculator
Overview
The Duration of Survival Calculator is a simple yet insightful Python script designed to calculate the total time a person has lived, expressed in various time units. This project explores how we perceive time by converting a given age into months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and even seconds.

Features
User Input Handling: Prompt users to input their age and choose a time unit (months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds).
Time Conversion: Accurately converts the user's age into the selected time unit.
Dynamic Output: Provides a clear and formatted output, showing how long the user has lived in the chosen time unit.
How It Works
The user inputs their age in years.
The script prompts the user to choose a time unit from a list.
The script calculates the duration in the chosen unit and displays the result.
If an invalid choice is made, the script informs the user and terminates.
